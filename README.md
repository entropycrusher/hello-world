# hello-world
my first repository, following along in the tutorial

Added a line to the README.md file for grins

Created a branch, readme-edits, and now I'm adding this line to the file.
My name is Tim, and I'm new to GitHub.  I have used Bazaar for a number of years, but for various reasons, it's time to migrate to GitHub.  Excited to see how it works for me.

Trying out the GitHub desktop client:
- First, I cloned the hello-world repository onto my hard drive.  I see it in the folder F:\Documents\GitHub\hello-world
- In the folder, I see this file, README.md
